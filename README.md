# project

Welcome to the Read Me guide for setting up the codes in this project.

In order to successfully implement the codes, we need to firstly download the two image files in the repository and save them to a file path. 

Then, 3 pieces of software need to be downloaded.

Firstly, create an account for Git using https://github.com/ 

Download the software needed to run Git on your desktop here https://git-scm.com/downloads

And now download GitHub Desktop https://desktop.github.com/.




Follow the instructions for installation, and when finished open GitHub Desktop. 

Go to File > Options > Accounts.

This will allow you to log in to your account in order to push and pull (Upload and download) from remote repositories such as the one you will be using today. 
You will firstly need to log into GitHub via a browser in order to authorise GitHub Desktop signing into your account.



Now that you are logged in, you can fork the repository for the project using  this link 
****   https://github.com/rrudkin/project   ****
This will create a copy of the repository for your own account to use. From GitHub, please download the two images so that they can be used in the code.



We now need to install Anaconda from here  https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/
Once installed, open the Anaconda Navigator so that an environment can be created. 


In the Git repository that you have cloned, there is an environmental.yml file. This lists the channels, dependencies and required packages.

From the Anaconda Navigator select the Environments tab, and then import. Click on the folder icon of Local Drive and navigate to where you saved the Environment.yml file. Select the file and import it.


Now to install the final piece of software

Select the Home tab in Anaconda Navigator, whilst ensuring that the environment is still selected. As we want to be able to run the codes, we need to install the right environments to do so. 
From the selection available, install  PyCharm Community and launch the software.


Using the Anaconda Navigator, and ensuring that the correct environment is still selected, launch PyCharm Community from the interface


You can now make changes to the code script. To run the code, press the green triangle. 
You will need to important some dependencies, so ensure that you click on these in the code interface to import them.
